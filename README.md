Our P2P chat (Peer-to-Peer chat) allows individuals to directly communicate with 
each other through a decentralized network without relying on a central server. 

In a P2P chat, each user's computer acts as both a client and a 
server, enabling direct communication between users without intermediaries.

See below to run our P2P chat.

## Working our P2P Chat
1. Open terminal and run "python3 server.py"
2. Open separate new terminal and run "python3 client.py"
3. Repeat step 2 for several multiple users.
4. On server side, click the "Start Chat" button.
5. On the client side, type a username and click to join.
6. Now send messages to the users online and leave when you are done.
7. Chat history is saved in our database.

## Warnings and notes
1. May have to change PORT number in server.py and client.py depending on your available port
2. May have to pip install PySimpleGUI
