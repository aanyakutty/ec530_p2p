# P2P Project for ECE530

P2P chat (Peer-to-Peer chat) is a type of instant messaging or communication system where two or more individuals can directly communicate with 
each other through a decentralized network without relying on a central server. In a P2P chat, each user's computer acts as both a client and a 
server, enabling direct communication between users without intermediaries.
Unlike traditional chat systems that rely on a centralized server to route messages between users, P2P chat does not require a central authority 
or a single point of failure. Instead, each user's computer is connected to other users' computers through a network of nodes, allowing them to 
send and receive messages directly.
P2P chat systems are often used for privacy-sensitive communication, such as in situations where users do not want their messages to be 
intercepted or monitored by third parties. They can also be used in situations where there is limited or no internet connectivity, such as in 
remote areas or during natural disasters, where a decentralized network can provide a way for people to communicate without relying on centralized 
infrastructure.

## Working our P2P Chat
1. Open terminal and run "python3 server.py"
2. Open separate new terminal and run "python3 client.py"
3. Repeat step 2 for several multiple users.
4. On server side, click the "Start Chat" button.
5. On the client side, type a username and click to join.
6. Now send messages to the users online and leave when you are done.
7. Chat history is saved in our database.
